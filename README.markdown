# Welcome to Baconography
Baconography is an open source reddit client built from the ground up to provide an excellent user experience on Windows 8 regardless of the status of your internet connection.

# Prerequisites for building
*   Visual Studio 2012 (Express should work)
*   Windows 8
*   [KitaroDB SDK](http://kitarodb.com/kitarodb-for-winrt/)

# Instructions for building
Open the solution file with Visual Studio 2012. If you don't already have one, you will be prompted for a developer license; all it takes is a Microsoft Live account.

Once it's opened you need to restore the NuGet packages. The easiest way to do that is to right click on the project and go to "Manage NuGet Packages...". There should be a button to restore the packages at the top of that dialog.

Now that everything is set up, you can build, deploy, and debug the solution

# What to do if things break
*   Make an issue for it here on github
*   Make a posting on [the Baconography subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/baconography)
*   Send messages on reddit to either hippiehunter or madkatalpha

# Things we can do right now
*   Store Links and Comments for offline viewing [Using KitaroDB](http://www.kitarodb.com)
*   Infinite scrolling everywhere
*   Support for browsing reddit while not logged in
*   Support for multiple saved account credentials for rapid switching
*   Voting, saving, reporting and all the things you expect to do to a link or comment
*   Integration with Windows Search, Share and File Picker (pick photos directly from reddit links)
*   Ability to pin subreddits to the start screen
*   Integrated markdown preview when creating a reply
*   Launch links in the app or open them in a browser
*   Optional filtering of NSFW content
*   Use the imgur api (and the other domains supported by RES) to download and display images/albums directly
*   On WinRT Show images inline RES style (including gifs), for links as well as comments
*   Get it on Windows Phone 8
